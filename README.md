# 2020_MetMuseum_CNN
Some scripts (with key pieces redacted) related to my MSCA 31009 Project, for using transfer learning to identify which culture created items in the Met collection

## Description
The Met Museum has a vast collection of antiquities, with origins across the globe.  In this project, we selected the five cultures with the most items in the met (America, Italy, France, China, and Japan), and used transfer learning to compare how several neural networks performed in classifying them based on images.

Networks tested include:
- Vanilla CNN
- AlexNet
- ResNet 50
